# Psychic-Game
In this version of Psychic Game, I have coded a computer random letter picker that the player then has to guess. The player gets 9 chances to guess correctly. If the player gets tbe letter correct within the 9 guesses, the computer will score a win for the player and start a new game with a new random letter. If the player does not guess the letter correctly in the 9 chances allotted, the computer will score a loss for the player and start a new game with a new random letter.
